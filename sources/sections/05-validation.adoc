== Validation rules

=== General

Validation of EXPRESS-Q files is crucial to ensure the correctness and consistency of mappings between ARM and MIM schemas. The following rules should be applied when validating EXPRESS-Q files.

=== Entity mapping validation

1. Each ENTITY_MAPPING must correspond to an entity defined in the ARM schema.
2. The AIM_ELEMENT specified must exist in the MIM schema.
3. The SOURCE referenced must be a valid ISO standard or other recognized source.
4. All EXPRESS_REF entries must refer to valid EXPRESS schemas.
5. The REFPATH must form a valid path from the ARM entity to the specified AIM_ELEMENT.
6. If ALT_MAP is specified, all alternative mappings must be valid MIM entities.

=== Attribute mapping validation

1. Each ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING must correspond to an attribute of the ARM entity being mapped.
2. The ASSERTION_TO value must be a valid type or entity in the MIM schema.
3. If specified, the AIM_ELEMENT must exist in the MIM schema.
4. The REFPATH for an attribute must form a valid path from the ARM attribute to the specified MIM element.

=== Reference path validation

1. All entities and attributes referenced in the REFPATH must exist in either the ARM or MIM schema, as appropriate.
2. Relationships between entities (e.g., subtype, supertype) must be consistent with the schema definitions.
3. Constraints specified in the REFPATH must use valid attributes or functions for the entities they constrain.
4. SELECT type extensions must be consistent with the schema definitions.
5. Aggregate references (using `[i]` or `[n]`) must only be applied to attributes defined as aggregates in the schema.

=== Overall consistency

1. The complete set of mappings must cover all entities and attributes in the ARM schema.
2. There should be no conflicting mappings (e.g., two different mappings for the same ARM entity or attribute).
3. The overall set of mappings should form a consistent and complete transformation from the ARM to the MIM schema.
