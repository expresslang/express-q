== Implementation guidelines

=== General

When implementing an EXPRESS-Q parser and validator, consider the following guidelines.

=== Parsing

1. Implement a lexical analyzer to tokenize the EXPRESS-Q input.
2. Develop a parser based on the EBNF grammar provided in this specification.
3. Create an abstract syntax tree (AST) or similar internal representation of the parsed EXPRESS-Q file.

=== Schema loading

1. Implement an EXPRESS schema parser or use an existing library to load and interpret ARM and MIM schemas.
2. Create internal representations of the schemas that allow for efficient querying of entities, attributes, and relationships.

=== Validation

1. Implement validation checks based on the rules outlined in the "Validation rules" section.
2. Perform two-pass validation:
   a. First pass: Check syntax and basic semantic rules (e.g., entity and attribute existence).
   b. Second pass: Validate complex semantic rules (e.g., consistency of reference paths).
3. Provide clear and informative error messages for validation failures.

=== Reference path interpretation

1. Implement a separate parser for the reference path syntax.
2. Develop algorithms to traverse reference paths within the context of the loaded schemas.
3. Implement functions to evaluate constraints specified in reference paths.

=== Performance considerations

1. Use efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables) for quick lookups of schema elements.
2. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed schema information.
3. Consider parallel processing for validating multiple entity or attribute mappings simultaneously.

=== Extensibility

1. Design the implementation to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements to the EXPRESS-Q language.
2. Use modular design to separate concerns (e.g., parsing, schema handling, validation).

=== Integration

1. Provide APIs or interfaces for integrating the EXPRESS-Q parser and validator into larger systems or workflows.
2. Consider implementing export functionality to generate reports or machine-readable representations of the validation results.
