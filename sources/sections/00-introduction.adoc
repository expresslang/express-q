== Introduction

EXPRESS-Q is a query language designed to work with EXPRESS schemas,
particularly in the context of STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product model
data) application protocols. It provides a formal mechanism for defining
mappings between Application Reference Model (ARM) and Model Implementation
Model (MIM) schemas, as well as specifying constraints on datasets that comply
with these schemas.

The primary purpose of EXPRESS-Q is to bridge the gap between conceptual models
(ARM) and their implementations (MIM), ensuring that data exchange between
different systems maintains semantic consistency. By providing a standardized
way to express these mappings and constraints, EXPRESS-Q facilitates more robust
and reliable data exchange in complex engineering and manufacturing
environments.
