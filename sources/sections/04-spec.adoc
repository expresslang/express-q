== EXPRESS-Q language specification

=== Overview

EXPRESS-Q is designed to work alongside EXPRESS schemas, providing a mechanism
to define mappings between ARM and MIM schemas, as well as specifying
constraints on datasets. The language uses a syntax similar to EXPRESS but
introduces new constructs specific to querying and mapping.

An EXPRESS-Q file typically consists of one or more entity mappings, each of
which defines how an ARM entity and its attributes correspond to MIM elements.
These mappings can include various declarations such as extensibility, AIM
elements, sources, EXPRESS references, reference paths, and alternative
mappings.

=== EBNF grammar

The following EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar defines the syntax of
EXPRESS-Q:

[source,ebnf]
----
include::../resources/express-q.ebnf[]
----

This grammar defines the overall structure of an EXPRESS-Q file, including
entity mappings, attribute mappings, reference paths, including various types
of relationships between entities and constraints, and various declarations.


=== Semantics

This section describes the meaning and usage of each major construct in EXPRESS-Q.

==== Entity mapping

[source,ebnf]
----
entity_mapping = "ENTITY_MAPPING" entity_name ";" newline
                 [ extensible_decl ]
                 [ aim_element_decl ]
                 [ source_decl ]
                 [ express_ref_decl ]
                 [ refpath_decl ]
                 [ alt_map_decl ]
                 { attribute_mapping }
                 "END_ENTITY_MAPPING" ";" ;
----

An entity mapping defines how an ARM entity corresponds to one or more MIM entities or constructs. It encapsulates all the information needed to map a single ARM entity to its MIM counterpart(s).

Usage::
* Begin with "ENTITY_MAPPING" followed by the ARM entity name.
* Include optional declarations for extensibility, AIM element, source, EXPRESS references, reference path, and alternative mappings.
* Include attribute mappings for the entity's attributes.
* End with "END_ENTITY_MAPPING".

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
EXTENSIBLE: FALSE;
AIM_ELEMENT: "product";
SOURCE: "ISO 10303-41";
EXPRESS_REF: ["product_definition_schema"];
REFPATH: {
  product <= product_definition_formation
  product_definition_formation.of_product -> product
};
ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING id;
ASSERTION_TO: "id";
AIM_ELEMENT: "product.id";
END_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING;
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----

==== Extensible declaration

[source,ebnf]
----
extensible_decl = "EXTENSIBLE" ":" boolean ";" newline ;
----

The extensible declaration specifies whether the entity mapping is extensible, corresponding to the extensibility of SELECT types in EXPRESS schemas.

Usage::
* Use "EXTENSIBLE: TRUE;" for extensible mappings.
* Use "EXTENSIBLE: FALSE;" for non-extensible mappings.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING ProductCategory;
EXTENSIBLE: TRUE;
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----

==== AIM element declaration

[source,ebnf]
----
aim_element_decl = "AIM_ELEMENT" ":" string ";" newline ;
----

The AIM element declaration specifies the corresponding AIM (MIM) element for the ARM entity, providing a direct link between the ARM and MIM schemas.

Usage::
* Specify the AIM element name as a string.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
AIM_ELEMENT: "product";
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----

==== Source declaration

[source,ebnf]
----
source_decl = "SOURCE" ":" string ";" newline ;
----

The source declaration indicates the source (typically an ISO standard) of the MIM element, which is crucial for traceability and maintaining consistency with relevant standards.

Usage::
* Specify the source as a string, typically an ISO standard number.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
SOURCE: "ISO 10303-41";
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----

==== EXPRESS reference declaration

[source,ebnf]
----
express_ref_decl = "EXPRESS_REF" ":" "[" [ string { "," string } ] "]" ";" newline ;
----

The EXPRESS reference declaration lists EXPRESS references related to the mapping, used to link the mapping to specific parts of the EXPRESS schemas or other relevant documentation.

Usage::
* Provide a comma-separated list of references enclosed in square brackets.
* Use an empty list "[]" if there are no references.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
EXPRESS_REF: ["product_definition_schema", "management_resources_schema"];
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----


==== Reference path declaration

===== General

The reference path syntax in EXPRESS-Q is based on the ISO 10303 Mapping
Specification and is used within the REFPATH sections to define precise mappings
between ARM and MIM elements. This syntax allows for complex relationships and
constraints to be expressed concisely.

[source,ebnf]
----
refpath_decl = "REFPATH" ":" "{" newline
               refpath_content
               "}" ";" newline ;
----

The reference path declaration defines the detailed mapping between ARM and MIM elements using the reference path syntax described earlier.

Usage::
* Begin with `REFPATH: {` and end with `};`.
* Each line in the content describes a step in the mapping path.
* Use indentation to indicate nested structures.
* Use symbols like `<=`, `=>`, `->` to indicate relationships between entities and attributes.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
REFPATH: {
  product <= product_definition_formation
  product_definition_formation.of_product -> product
  {product.name -> product.name
   product.description -> product.description}
};
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----



===== Symbols and meaning

The reference path syntax uses several symbols to express relationships and constraints. These symbols are derived from the ISO 10303 Mapping Specification:

`[]`::
Enclosed section constrains multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference
path required to satisfy an information requirement.

`()`::
Enclosed section constrains multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference
path identified as alternatives within the mapping.

`{}`::
Enclosed section constrains the reference path to satisfy an information
requirement.

`<>`::
Enclosed section constrains one or more required reference paths.

`||`::
Enclosed section constrains the supertype entity.

`->`::
The attribute whose name precedes the symbol references the entity or select type whose name follows the symbol.

`<-`::
The entity or select type whose name precedes the symbol is referenced by the entity attribute whose name follows the symbol.

`[i]`::
The attribute whose name precedes the symbol is an aggregate; any element of that aggregate is referred to.

`[n]`::
The attribute whose name precedes the symbol is an ordered aggregate; member n of that aggregate is referred to.

`=>`::
The entity whose name precedes the symbol is a supertype of the entity whose name follows the symbol.

`<=`::
The entity whose name precedes the symbol is a subtype of the entity whose name follows the symbol.

`=`::
The string, select, or enumeration type is constrained to a choice or value.

`\`::
The reference path expression continues on the next line.

`*`::
One or more instances of the relationship entity data type may be assembled in a relationship tree structure.

`--`::
The text following is a comment or introduces a clause reference.

`*>`::
The select or enumeration type whose name precedes the symbol is extended into the select or enumeration type whose name follows the symbol.

`<*`::
The select or enumeration type whose name precedes the symbol is an extension of the select or enumeration type whose name follows the symbol.

`!{}`::
Section enclosed by `{}` indicates a negative constraint placed on the mapping.


===== Usage and examples

The reference path syntax is used to define precise mappings between ARM and MIM
elements. Here are some examples demonstrating various aspects of the syntax:

[example]
.Simple attribute mapping
====
[source]
----
REFPATH: {
  product.id -> id
}
----
====

[example]
.Subtype relationship
====
[source]
----
REFPATH: {
  mechanical_context <= product_context
}
----
====

[example]
.Complex mapping with alternatives and constraints
====
[source]
----
REFPATH: {
  shape_representation <= representation
  {representation.items[i] -> representation_item
   representation_item => 
   (geometric_representation_item
    [geometric_representation_item.dim = 3] |
    mapped_item)
  }
}
----
====

[example]
.Select type extension
====
[source]
----
REFPATH: {
  person_and_organization_select *> organization
}
----
====

[example]
.Negative constraint
====
[source]
----
REFPATH: {
  product_definition_formation
  !{product_definition_formation.make_or_buy = bought_item}
}
----
====

===== Validation rules for reference paths

When validating reference paths, the following rules should be applied:

1. All referenced entities and attributes must exist in the corresponding ARM or MIM schema.
2. The relationships between entities (supertype, subtype, attribute reference) must be consistent with the schema definitions.
3. Constraints must be syntactically correct and use only attributes or functions that are valid for the constrained entity.
4. Select type extensions must be consistent with the schema definitions.
5. Aggregate references (using `[i]` or `[n]`) must be applied only to attributes defined as aggregates in the schema.
6. Alternative mappings (using parentheses) must all be valid according to the schema.
7. Negative constraints must be logically consistent with the rest of the mapping and the schema definitions.
8. The overall structure of the reference path must form a valid path through the schema, connecting the source ARM entity to the target MIM entity or attribute.


==== Alternative mapping declaration

[source,ebnf]
----
alt_map_decl = "ALT_MAP" ":" "[" [ string { "," string } ] "]" ";" newline ;
----

The alternative mapping declaration specifies alternative mappings, allowing for flexibility in cases where multiple valid mappings exist.

Usage::
* Provide a comma-separated list of alternative mappings enclosed in square brackets.
* Use an empty list "[]" if there are no alternative mappings.

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING GeometricRepresentation;
ALT_MAP: ["shape_representation", "tessellated_shape_representation"];
...
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
----

==== Attribute mapping

[source,ebnf]
----
attribute_mapping = "ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING" attribute_name ";" newline
                    "ASSERTION_TO" ":" string ";" newline
                    [ aim_element_decl ]
                    [ source_decl ]
                    [ express_ref_decl ]
                    [ refpath_decl ]
                    "END_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING" ";" newline ;
----

An attribute mapping defines how an individual attribute of an ARM entity corresponds to elements in the MIM schema.

Usage::
* Begin with "ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING" followed by the attribute name.
* Specify the ASSERTION_TO value, which indicates the corresponding MIM element or type.
* Optionally include AIM_ELEMENT, SOURCE, EXPRESS_REF, and REFPATH declarations.
* End with "END_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING".

[example]
----
ENTITY_MAPPING Product;
ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING id;
ASSERTION_TO: "id";
AIM_ELEMENT: "product.id";
REFPATH: {
  product.id -> id
};
END_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING;

ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING name;
ASSERTION_TO: "label";
AIM_ELEMENT: "product.name";
SOURCE: "ISO 10303-41";
EXPRESS_REF: ["product_definition_schema"];
REFPATH: {
  product.name -> name
};
END_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING;
END_ENTITY_MAPPING;
