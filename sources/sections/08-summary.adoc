== Summary

EXPRESS-Q provides a powerful and flexible language for defining mappings between ARM and MIM schemas in the context of STEP application protocols. By offering a standardized way to express these mappings, EXPRESS-Q facilitates more robust and reliable data exchange in complex engineering and manufacturing environments.

Key features of EXPRESS-Q include:

1. A syntax that is familiar to users of EXPRESS, reducing the learning curve.
2. The ability to define detailed mappings between ARM and MIM entities and attributes.
3. Support for complex reference paths, allowing for navigation through intricate schema relationships.
4. Mechanisms for specifying constraints and alternative mappings.
5. Clear separation of entity and attribute mappings for improved readability and maintainability.

The validation rules and implementation guidelines provided in this specification aim to ensure consistent interpretation and implementation of EXPRESS-Q across different tools and systems.

== Future considerations

As the use of EXPRESS-Q grows and evolves, several areas may be considered for future enhancements:

=== Extended constraint language

Future versions of EXPRESS-Q might benefit from a more expressive constraint language, allowing for more complex conditions and transformations to be specified within mappings.

=== Integration with other standards

Consideration should be given to how EXPRESS-Q can be integrated with other relevant standards and technologies, such as ontology languages or model transformation frameworks.

=== Tool support

Development of standardized libraries and tools for parsing, validating, and processing EXPRESS-Q files would greatly facilitate its adoption and use.

=== Reverse mapping capabilities

Future versions might include capabilities for defining bi-directional mappings, allowing for the generation of ARM instances from MIM data.

=== Performance optimizations

As EXPRESS-Q is used with increasingly large and complex schemas, performance optimizations in both the language design and implementation guidelines may become necessary.
